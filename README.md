## Features
* HEART RATE: shows five colored zones. Zone is made thicker when in zone and indicator shows where in the zone you are.
* HEART RATE SETTINS: you can set your own zones in settings
* TIME: 12/24h mode based on system settings.
* PACE: pace in km/min or mi/min based on system settings (as average of the last 10 values).
* AVG PACE: average pace over the whole activity.
* DISTANCE: elapsed distance in km or miles based on system settings.
* DURATION: duration of the activity in [hh:]mm:ss
* use bright or dark color scheme based on the background color setting of the app (Settings/Apps/Run/Background Color).
  needs at least a firmware with SDK 1.2 compatibility (otherwise bright scheme is always used).
